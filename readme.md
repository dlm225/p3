Developer's Best Friend is a simple content generation site comprised of two sections - the first provides the user the ability to create between 1 and 50 paragraphs of Lorem-Ipsum text, the second provides the user the ability to create between 1 and 50 complete fake personas.  Each persona is output to the screen with full name, date of birth, address, phone number, email address, place of work, and a social media profile image.  Content is easily extracted from the site through copy-paste to any application the user desires.
